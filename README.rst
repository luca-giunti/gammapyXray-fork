GammapyXray 
=======
A Python tool for the analysis of Gamma-ray and X-ray data in a unified framework, using physically-motivated spectral models.

The scripts provided in this folder are built on Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, Gammapy, Naima, Sherpa and Xspec. A software description is provided in the following publication: TBD

Installation and Set-up
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These instructions assume that you have previously installed a version of `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ on your machine.

Set-up the work environment with conda::

  conda create -n gammapyXray
  conda activate gammapyXray
  conda install -c https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/conda/ciao -c conda-forge ciao sherpa
  conda install -c conda-forge gammapy

`Install JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/install>`_ (recommended). 

If you need to use the physical models provided by `Naima <https://naima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, follow `these instructions <https://naima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ (optional).

Download the ZIPped contents of this folder directly from the main GitHub `page <https://github.com/luca-giunti/gammapyXray>`_, or equivalently from the `Zenodo <TBD>`_ or `Software Heritage <TBD>`_ archives. Extract under your home directory::

  cd
  unzip ~/Downloads/gammapyXray-main.zip
  
To check that the installation has succeeded and start using the package, navigate to the ``gammapyXray-main`` folder and try to execute the example notebook::

  cd gammapyXray-main
  jupyter notebook example_nb.ipynb
